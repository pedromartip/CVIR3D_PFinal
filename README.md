* Git (for cloning the repository)

## How to install dependencies?

Use: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Via command, go to the source code path and use `python image_stitching.py`. If you want to use your images, modify the input files at the beginning of the principal cell. Also, if you want to run it with a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code), open the panorama_creation.ipynb and run all the cells.
